In addition to making its source code available publicly, [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) offers and maintains a minimal setup that works out-of-the-box for simple use cases.

[Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) encourage everyone to regularly update their [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) installations to get the best and the most recent [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) experience.

## Create a backeup/snapshot

Make Sure you have a quickly revertable backup/snapshot.

## Download the closer update

You have to update your [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) one by one, so you can't upgrade from `20.x` to `22.x` or some thing.

Also read the release notes carefully. some times there are more steps before updating to a release:

[https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/releases](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/releases)

Supposing the next one is `21.9.0`:

```shell
wget -qO- https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/archive/refs/tags/21.9.0.tar.gz | tar xvz
```

And go to the directory:

```shell
cd ./self-hosted-21.9.0
```

## Copy the config/env files to the new version directory

These are the config files. It's not bad to compare the old and new config files before moving, to make sure the formats are same.

* `sentry/config.yml`
* `sentry/sentry.conf.py`

Also you should update the values of the env file. Note that you shouldn't copy entire values of the prev values, while it includes the docker image tags too.

* `.env`

## Run the installation script

```shell
sudo bash ./install.sh
```

## Start the services

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```
