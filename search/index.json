وجود دارد که با نام های «آلکیبیادس اول» و «آلکیبیادس دوم» شناخته می شوند. «آلکیبیادس اول»، رساله ای است درباب «چه باید کرد؟» و «ماهیت آدمی». و من آن را در «مجموعه آثار افلاطون»، انتشارات خوارزمی خواندم.\nآلکیبیادس جوان خوش چهره و خوش اندامی ست، برخواسته از یکی از خانواده های ثروتمند و قدرتمند آتن و با استکبار سودای فرمانروایی آتن را در سر می پروراند.\nسقراط در نقاب عاشقی او، تمنّای مصاحبت دارد. روز ها پاپی او می شود تا او رابه چنگ گفتگوی با خود می اندازد.\n آلکیبیادس: از من چه می خواهی و به چه امید همه جا سایه وار دنبال من می آیی؟ به راستی از رفتار تو در شگفتم و میل دارم بدانم چرا مرا رها نمی کنی …\n سقراط سخن آغاز می کند و به او وعده می دهد که تنها کسی است که می تواند او را به آرزویش، یعنی حکمرانی آتن برساند.\nآلکیبیادس که با تردید به او می نگرد، مشتاق می شود تا بداند چه خواهد شنید.\nابتدا سقراط آرزوی آلکیبیادس را زیر ضرب سوال می کشد و به او می فهماند چیزی بیشتر از عوام راجع به موضوع حکمرانی یعنی عدل و ظلم و جنگ و صلح نمی داند. حتی برداشت مردم از عدل و ظلم ممکن است در تضاد باشد و بداهت مفهوم عدالت محل پرسش است.\n سقراط: مردمان به سبب اختلاف نظر در عدل و ظلم خون یکدیگر را ریخته اند.\n سقراط پس از آن چنان مسلّمات و مشهورات ذهن آلکیبیادس را به چالش می کشد که گاه در اثبات چیزی سخن می راند و دمی بعد در ردّ آن! و بدین گونه سستی عقیده اش را به او آشکار می کند.\n سقراط: هرگاه درباره مطلبی بر خلاف میل خود، گاه چنین بیاندیشی و گاه چنان، آیا این خود دلیل کافی نخواهد بود بر اینکه آن نطلب را براستی نمی دانی؟\n او گستاخانه ضربات خود را ادامه می دهد تا آلکیبیادس را در جهل خود به اعتراف بکشاند.\n سقراط: تصدیق می کنی که ابله ترین مردمانی و از آن رو دیوانه وار به امور سیاسی روی می آوری، بی آنکه از تربیت درست که لازمه پرداختن به سیاست است بهره گرفته باشی؟\n او در چند بند مفصلاً فضیلت و قدرت پادشاه ایران و دست تهی یونان را از آن فضائل به او یادآور می شود.\n سقراط: باید پرسید پشت گرمی این آلکیبیادس به چیست که از اردشیر باک ندارد؟ باید نخست بسی چیزها بیاموزی و روح خود را تربیت کنی و آنگاه دم از همسری پادشاه ایران بزنی.\n پس از آن سقراط سعی می کند ضمن انصراف دادن آلکیبیادس از آرزوی حکمرانی ، او را متوجه ضرورت شناختن خویشتن کند.\n سقراط: فرزند، پند مرا بشنو و آن دستور گرانقدر معبد دلفی را می گوید «خود را بشناس» آویزه گوش خود ساز و باور کن که رقیبان راستین تو آنانند (ایرانیان) نه اینان که تو می پنداری (اهل آتن).\n و به او نشان می دهد شناختن خویش یعنی شناختن روح و نیکبختی جز با خوشتن داری و کسب فضیلت میسّر نخواهد شد.\n سقراط: آدمی همواره باید در اندیشه روح خود باشد و تنها به آن بپردازد و اندیشه تن و دارایی خود را به دیگران واگذار کند.\n سپس به امر حکومت می پردازد و تنها حکومت نیکان خودشناس حائز فضیلت را برای نیک بخت کردن جامعه ممکن می داند.\n سقراط: باید نخست بکوشی تا خود از فضیلت بهره ور گردی، و هر کس دیگری هم که به اداره امور خصوصی خود قناعت نورزد بلکه آرزوی فرمان روایی بر جامعه را در سر بپروراند ناچار است چنان کند. باید بکوشی که هم تو خود از عدالت و خویشتن داری بهره برگیری و هم دولت و جامعه تو عادل و خویشتن دار گردند.\n و ضمانت نیک بختی انسان و جامعه را در برقرای عدالت و خویشتن داری می بیند.\n سقراط: اگر تو و جامعه در هر کار از عدالت و خویشتن داری پیروی کنید، رفتار شما در همه حال نیک خواهد بود و خدا را پسند خواهد آمد.\n

سایلاس مارنر اثر جورج الیوت را خواندم، کتاب سطح چهارم سری بوک وورمز از انتشارات آکسفورد بود.\nاولین نکته جالب این کتاب نویسنده آن است. نویسنده این کتاب یک زن انگلیسی به نام ماری آن اوانز است که در قرن 19 ام میلادی می زیسته و برای آثارش از نام مستعار مردانه جورج الیوت استفاده می کرده تا آثارش مورد توجه بیشتری قرار گیرد.\nکتاب درباره شکست و رنج و سیرورت احوال یک انسان معمولی است. زمانه در چند پرده او را چنان می فشرد که از جا در می رود. همه امید و اندوخته اش از او ستانده می شود. ابتدا به این بی عدالتی معترض می شود، اما در نهایت اجر می بیند و به آسایش می رسد.\nسایلاس مارنر یک بافنده پارچه است که در یک مثلث عشقی، با صحنه سازی ای که توسط صمیمی ترین دوستش برای متهم کردن او به سرقت انجام می شود، بازی را به رقیب می بازد و معشوق خود را با افسوس بسیار از دست می دهد.\nاو که پیش از این انسان معتقد و مذهبی ای بود، به ناگاه به چالش می افتد که چرا جواب نیک بودنش در این دنیا چنین نا عادلانه داده می شود و لا مذهب می شود.\nمهاجرت می کند و در قریه ای کوچک سر در لاک خود می برد و با ماشین بافندگی اش به کار و اندوختن دستمزد هایش می پردازد.\nدر یک شب سرد زمستانی که برای جمع آوری هیزم بیرون رفته، دفینه ای که همه اندوخته چندین سال زحمتش را نگه می داشته دزدیده می شود و این ماجرا او را در دومین بحران اساسی زندگی اش فرو می برد.\nتلاش هایش برای پیدا کردن سارق ناکام می ماند و ناامیدی زندگی بی رونقش را سیاه تر می کند. دیگر حتی انگیزه ای برای کار کردن هم ندارد. این حال در او ادامه می یابد تا اینکه در یکی از شبهای تنهایی اش صدای ناله ای از بیرون می شنود. به بیرون می رود. پیکر زنی را می بیند افتاده در برف و نوزادی که در آغوش مادرِ مرده ی خود زار می زند.\nمارنر نوزاد را به داخل می برد و شیفته او می شود. نوزاد او را یاد خواهر خردسالش که در کودکی از دنیا رفته می اندازد. تصمیم می گیرد او را نگه دارد و برایش پدری کند. چراغ امید دوباره در کلبه محقرش روشن می شود. حالا دوباره دلیلی برای صبح زود از خواب بیدار شدن دارد.\nپدر واقعی دخترک که پسر متمکن ولایت است و بسته شدن نطفه کودک، حاصل هوسرانی از سر بی فکری او در دوره خامی جوانیست، از ترس آبرو و به هم خوردن ازدواج رسمی اش، کودک را در روز مرگ مادرش گردن نمی گیرد و در تمام این مدت دورا دور درگیر عذاب وجدان و حس گناهکاری خویش است.\nدختر که پا به سن تمییز می گذارد، پدر واقعی تصمیم می گیرد ماجرا را به مارنر بگوید و از او بخواهد که سرپرستی دختر را به او برگرداند. مارنر شوکه می شود و بحران سوم زندگی اش را تجربه می کند. ترس پوچی و نا امیدی از دست دادن ثمره محبت و عمرش، قلبش را می فشرد.\nدختر جوان اما درخواست پدر واقعی را علی رغم رفاه و آسایشی که می توانست برای او در پی داشته باشد پس می زند و به آغوش مارنر باز می گردد. دخترک ازدواج میکند و برای همیشه در گوشه ای از خانه مارنر به زندگی ادامه می دهد.\n","date":"2023-10-23T00:00:00Z","image":"https://ziaenezhad.ir/p/%D8%B3%D8%A7%DB%8C%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B3-%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%86%D8%B1/Silas-Marner-2_hu1af7085a32335ca07130f7e5225f8413_65559_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://ziaenezhad.ir/p/%D8%B3%D8%A7%DB%8C%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B3-%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%86%D8%B1/","title":"سایلاس

پرداخته است و نه هر کافری. همچنین در آیه 32 شرط این توصیفات را کفر پس از تبیین هدایت می داند. این تعبیر با تصور عامی که راجع به کفار در عصر حاضر وجود دارد که همه غیر مسلمین، ذیل کفار با چنین احکام شداد و غلاضی در نظر گرفته می شود در تضاد است.\nجنگ برای صلح  فَإِذَا لَقِيتُمُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا فَضَرْبَ الرِّقَابِ حَتَّىٰ إِذَا أَثْخَنتُمُوهُمْ فَشُدُّوا الْوَثَاقَ فَإِمَّا مَنًّا بَعْدُ وَإِمَّا فِدَاءً حَتَّىٰ تَضَعَ الْحَرْبُ أَوْزَارَهَا ۚ ذَٰلِكَ وَلَوْ يَشَاءُ اللَّهُ لَانتَصَرَ مِنْهُمْ وَلَٰكِن لِّيَبْلُوَ بَعْضَكُم بِبَعْضٍ ۗ وَالَّذِينَ قُتِلُوا فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ فَلَن يُضِلَّ أَعْمَالَهُمْ ‎﴿٤﴾‏\n آیه چهارم اگر چه ظاهر خشن و خونباری دارد، امّا اولا از سر انفعال در برابر سنگ اندازی و جنگ طلبی کفّار است و ثانیا کاملا در جهت برقراری صلح طلبی و توقف درگیری هاست.\nبجنگید تا غربال کنیم در دو آیه 4 و 31 اصالت جنگ برای نفس جنگ انکار شده و غایت امر به قتال را معلوم شدن امتحان بشر در مقابله بشر بر علیه بشر، برای شناخت مجاهدین و صابرین (که به نظر بنده یعنی صاحبان اراده آزاد) از غیر است.\n وَلَنَبْلُوَنَّكُمْ حَتَّىٰ نَعْلَمَ الْمُجَاهِدِينَ مِنكُمْ وَالصَّابِرِينَ وَنَبْلُوَ أَخْبَارَكُمْ ‎﴿٣١﴾\n مسلک مومن بودن  يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِن تَنصُرُوا اللَّهَ يَنصُرْكُمْ وَيُثَبِّتْ أَقْدَامَكُمْ ‎﴿٧﴾\n آیه هفتم به روابط پیچیده ایمان، توسعه فردی، مجاهدت و توفیقات مادّی مومنین می پردازد. ثبات قدم، به عنوان نقطه مقابل تشویش و پراکندگی ذهنی با درگیر شدن در امر الهی و بازخورد آن یعنی نصرت الهی حاصل می شود. همچنین ممکن است به تاثیر عمل در اصلاح فکر اشاره داشته باشد.\n ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّ اللَّهَ مَوْلَى الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَأَنَّ الْكَافِرِينَ لَا مَوْلَىٰ لَهُمْ ‎﴿١١﴾‏\n مومن متواضعانه خود را فقیر می بیند و در جهان عبد و مولی زیست می کند. او حقیقت متعالی، غنی و کامل مقابل خود را، مولای خویش می گیرد و به اطاعت امر او گردن می نهد تا چون او کامل شود. االعُبودِيَّةُ جَوهَرَةٌ كُنهُ ها الرُّبوبيّةُ.\nکافر امّا در جهان بی آرمانی زندگی می کند. آرزویی فراتر از آب و گلی که در آن می زیید ندارد. چیزی فراتر از ماده نمی بینند تا تمنّای آن را داشته باشند، پس در برابر هیچ چیز و هیچ کس خاشع نیست. چنانچه در آیه بعد، تمتع آنها از دنیا را با تمتعی که یک حیوان می برد یکی می گیرد:\n وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا يَتَمَتَّعُونَ وَيَأْكُلُونَ كَمَا تَأْكُلُ الْأَنْعَامُ وَالنَّارُ مَثْوًى لَّهُمْ ‎﴿١٢﴾‏\n یک فکت تاریخی منابع معتبر برای شناخت وقایع عصر نزول قرآن محدود است. اینکه در خود قرآن به چیزی از آن ها اشاره شود، با ارزش است.\n وَكَأَيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ هِيَ أَشَدُّ قُوَّةً مِّن قَرْيَتِكَ الَّتِي أَخْرَجَتْكَ أَهْلَكْنَاهُمْ فَلَا نَاصِرَ لَهُمْ ‎﴿١٣﴾\n آیه سیزدهم به ما می گوید محمد «ص» از مکّه اخراج شده است.\nمخاطب خاص قشر قرآن آیه 15 برای توصیف بهشت از عباراتی که آشنا و مطبوع عرب عصر نزول است بهره می برد. اینکه آب بهشت غیر گل آلود است، شاید چندان به معنی استعلا و مطلوبیت آن برای ساکنین سایر ازمنه و امکنه کره خاکی نباشد.\nاین می تواند تایید کننده مکان مند و زمان مند بودن قشر قرآن باشد و البته نمی توان منکر بطون فرا زمانی و فرا مکانی آن شد.\nقریب دانستن آخر الزمان در مدخل محمد«ص» از ویکیپدیای فارسی آمده است:\n جدا از آیات پراکنده، حداقل سی سورهٔ پایانی در ترتیب فعلی سوره‌ها دربارهٔ هشدار نزدیکی پایان جهان است. اصطلاح رایج قرآن برای آخرالزمان، «الساعَة» است، در لغت به‌معنای «همین لحظه.» اگرچه قرآن زمان دقیق آخرالزمان را مشخص نمی‌کند، اما تاکیدهای مکررش به فوریت آن، سبب شده برخی از پژوهشگران محمّد را در واقع یک «واعظ آخرالزمانی» محسوب کنند. به گفتهٔ کاسانوا، محمّد و پیروانش نه تنها معتقد به نزدیکی آخرالزمان بودند، بلکه انتظار داشتند که دنیا پیش از مرگِ خود محمّد نابود شود.\n آیه 18 ام صراحتا وقوع قیامت را نزدیک و حتی نشانه های وقوع آن را محقق می داند. این اشاره می تواند مویّد نظر شرق شناسان باشد و این سوال را در ذهن پدید می آورد که از نگاه مخاطب عرفی عصر نزول آیا چنین ادعای که پس از گذشت 14 قرن هنوز محقق نشده صادق بوده؟\n فَهَلْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلَّا السَّاعَةَ أَن تَأْتِيَهُم بَغْتَةً ۖ فَقَدْ جَاءَ أَشْرَاطُهَا ۚ فَأَنَّىٰ لَهُمْ إِذَا جَاءَتْهُمْ ذِكْرَاهُمْ ‎﴿١٨﴾\n علیه عصمت  فَاعْلَمْ أَنَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ وَاسْتَغْفِرْ لِذَنبِكَ وَلِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَاتِ ۗ وَاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ مُتَقَلَّبَكُمْ وَمَثْوَاكُمْ ‎﴿١٩﴾‏\n ظاهر آیه دلالت بر این دارد که خدا به رسول امر می کند برای گناهش استغفار کند. این می تواند علیه نظریه عصمت باشد.\nامکان و امر به تدبر در قرآن  أَفَلَا يَتَدَبَّرُونَ الْقُرْآنَ أَمْ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبٍ أَقْفَالُهَا ‎﴿٢٤﴾\n آیه 24 دلالت به امر دارد و شاید بتوان تعبیر به وجوب تدبّر در قرآن نمود.\nعلیه اطاعت از اولوالامر  يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَطِيعُوا اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُوا الرَّسُولَ وَلَا تُبْطِلُوا أَعْمَالَكُمْ ‎﴿٣٣﴾‏\n اینکه در این آیه و بعض آیات مشابه اطاعت از اولوالامر آورده نشده، می تواند نشان دهنده آن باشد که این سه همیشه با هم نیستند و حساب اولوالامر از دو شخص اول جداست. چنانچه مثلا پیوندی که در مورد صلات و زکات در قرآن هست و همه جا در کنار هم آمده اند، را در مورد اولوالامر و دو شخص اول نمی بینیم.\n","date":"2023-09-29T00:00:00Z","image":"https://ziaenezhad.ir/p/%D8%AA%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%91%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AA%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%87-%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%AF-%D8%B5/ahmet-kurem-fJkO8F7D1Hk-unsplash_hu3d03a01dcc18bc5be0e67db3d8d209a6_5494379_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://ziaenezhad.ir/p/%D8%AA%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%91%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AA%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%87-%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%AF-%D8%B5/","title":"تامّلاتی

پرسش از منشاء حیات مهم است؟"},{"content":"واقعیت این است که در حال حاضر هیچ توضیح کامل علمی برای منشاء حیات، وجود ندارد. محقیقن در سرتاسر دنیا در حال تلاش برای گشودن راز این معمّا هستند و اینجا قرار است به برخی از اکتشافات درباره این موضوع اشاره شود:\nنظریه تکامل داروین نظریه تکامل زیستی داروین به ما می گوید ممکن است تمامی گونه های زیستی از یک مخلوق بسیط واحد در گذشته های دور نشئات گرفته باشند.\nاین ایده مبتنی بر مشاهدات بسیاری بود. یکی از آن مشاهدات این بود که وقتی موجودات زنده تولید مثل می کنند، اغلب فرزندان، با صفات1 تصادفی جدید متولد می شوند.\nفرزندانی که دارای ویژگی های تصادفی جدید منفی هستند کمتر احتمال دارد زنده بمانند و در آن سو، فرزندانی که دارای ویژگی های تصادفی مثبت جدید هستند بیشتر احتمال دارد زنده بمانند و این ویژگی ها را به فرزندان خود منتقل کنند.\nگونه بسیطِ حیات با گذشت چند نسل از ایجاد و گزینش صفات مثبت، علاوه بر تکامل به اشکال پیچیده تر، می تواند به گونه های2 دیگری نیز منشعب گردد.\nگزارش مشاهدات فسیل های گونه های متقدّم، نظریه داروین را به طور قاطع3 تایید می کنند: هر چه بیشتر به گذشته بازگردیم، اشکال حیات ساده و ساده تر می شوند.\nاین گزارش نشان می دهد4؛ ظهور حیات در کره زمین برای اولین بار، تقریبا5 سه و نیم میلیارد سال قبل و از تجمیع سلول های بسیط اولیه پدید آمده6.\nاولین مخلوق امّا آن اولین مخلوق زنده تولید مثل کننده چگونه بوجود آمده است7؟ حتی ابتدایی ترین باکتری زنده هم بسیار پیچیده تر از آن است که تصور کنیم در یک مرحله به مقصود حیات جهیده باشد.\nعلاوه بر این8، پرسش از نحو احراز شرایط حیات برای مخلوق اول، مساله ای نبود که نظریه تکامل زیستی در تدارک تشکیل پاسخی برای آن باشد، چرا که توان تولید مثلِ مخلوق اول، مفروض مساله داروین بود.\nمنشاء حیات، نیاز به توضیح خاص خود را دارد.\nتوضیح شیمی برای منشاء حیات تا این لحظه امیدوار کننده ترین ایده برای توضیح منشاء حیات، توضیح شیمیایی از نحوه ایجاد حیات است.\nشیمی مطالعه‌ی ماده است؛ به طور خاص، نحوه تعامل و ترکیب اتم‌ها برای تشکیل مولکول‌ها و نحوه تعامل و ترکیب این مولکول‌ها برای تشکیل سیستم‌ها و ساختارهای بزرگتر.\nهمه چیز از مواد شیمیایی ساخته شده است؛ هوایی که تنفس می‌کنیم، زمینی که بر آن قدم می‌گذاریم، کفش‌هایی که پوشیده‌ایم و البته پاهایی که درون کفش‌هایمان قرار دارد.\nرابطه شیمی و حیات از دو جهت مهم برقرار است:\n1- چرخه های زیستی اگر به سلول‌های هر موجود زنده ای نگاه کنید، حتی گیاهان، که معمولاً به عنوان موجودی فعال به نظر نمی‌آید، جهانی پر از اتفاقات و تغییرات خواهید یافت!\nواکنش‌های شیمیایی در موجودات زنده به صورت فرآیندهایی مرتب و پیوسته اتفاق می‌افتند و هر واکنش، جرقه شکل گرفتن واکنش بعدی ست. دانشمندان این سلسه واکنش‌های شیمیایی را چرخه های زیستی9 می‌نامند.\n2- واحد های سازنده دومین رابطه شیمی و حیات این است که سلول‌های زنده از مولکول‌های شیمیایی ساخته شده‌اند. این مولکول‌ها مانند اسیدهای آمینه و قندها، به عنوان واحدهای سازنده با یکدیگر ترکیب می‌شوند و ساختارهای بسیار پیچیده و منظمی10 مانند ژن‌ها، پروتئین‌ها و غشاهای سلولی11 تشکیل می‌دهند.\nحیات در لوله آزمایشگاه در ابتدا فکر می‌شد نمی‌توان مولکول‌های سازنده حیات را در خارج یافت یا بوجود آورد. همچنین، هیچ ایده‌ای نبود که چه چیز به فعالیت‌های زیستی نیرو می‌بخشد یا چگونه واکنش های شیمیایی منحصربه‌فرد آن تولید می‌شوند. دانشمندان نتیجه می گرفتند که حیات باید از یک انرژی ناشناخته نیرو گرفته باشد و آن را قوّه حیات12 می نامیدند.\nتولید مصنوعی مولکول های زیستی در سال 1828، یک شیمی‌دان به نام فریدریش ولر توانست به طور اتفاقی اوره را در آزمایشگاه خود تولید کند. اوره یکی از اجزای اصلی ادرار و یکی از بسیار مواد شیمیایی است که در آن زمان فکر می‌شد که تنها داخل موجودات زنده و به مدد قوّه حیات یافت می‌شود.\nتولید مصنوعی اوره نشان داد، حیات احتمالاً نه از یک نیروی مرموز، بلکه از واکنش‌های شیمیایی عادی پا گرفته باشد. چیزی که می‌توان آن را مورد مطالعه و آزمایش قرار داد.\nپس از آن تعداد زیادی از مولکول‌ها و واکنش های شیمیایی سلولی در آزمایشگاه بازساخته شده‌اند و این به وضوح نشان داد حیات از واکنش‌های شیمیایی عادی تشکیل شده و ممکن است نشات گرفته از شیمی غیرزنده باشد.\nتکامل شیمیایی در ادامه، فرآیندی به نام تکامل شیمیایی کشف گردید. وقتی مولکول‌های ساده در معرض یک منبع انرژی رها قرار می گیرند، در نتیجه تعامل با یکدیگر، مولکول‌های بزرگتر و پیچیده‌تری را تشکیل می دهند. آزمایش‌ها نشان داده‌اند؛ زنجیره‌های واکنش‌های شیمیایی می‌توانند توسعه یابند، به طوری که برخی از آن‌ها می توانند شبیه13 به چرخه های زیستی حیات باشند!\nهمچنین کشف شد، برخی مولکول‌ها توانایی قابل توجهی دارند تا به ساختارهای پیچیده و مرتبی از خود تبدیل شوند. برخی از این مولکول‌ها به صورت خودکار، کره‌های تهی14 همسان15 با غشاهای سلول‌های زنده تشکیل می‌دهند یا برخی به صورت خودبخودی به ستون‌های بلندی شبیه به خصوصیت های16 DNA در موجودات زنده تبدیل می‌شوند.\nمولکول های حیات در خارج از زمین بسیاری از واحدهای سازنده‌ی حیات، مانند اسیدهای آمینه و قندها، در شهاب سنگ هایی17 که از فضا به زمین سقوط می‌کنند، وجود دارند و این نشان می‌دهد که این مولکول‌های ویژه به صورت خودبخودی18 تولید می‌شوند و در سراسر منظومه شمسی و احتمالاً در زمین باستان وجود داشته اند.\nنتیجه گیری هنوز سوالات زیادی راجع به منشأ حیات وجود دارند:\n چگونه اولین مولکول‌های زیستی با همکاری هم توانستند در نهایت19 کد های ژنتیک را تولید کنند؟ گونه اولیه تولید مثل کننده چگونه بوده است؟ آیا سلول های امروزی را می توان امتداد آنها دانست؟ آیا واقعا اشکال ابتدایی حیات، ساده تر از گونه های فعلی بوده اند؟ و در نهایت، سوال بسیار جالب‌تر اینکه، چقدر احتمال دارد که حیات در مناطق دیگری از کهکشان ما شکل گرفته باشد یا در حال شکل‌گیری باشد؟  خب \u0026hellip; به سوال اصلی برگردیم: علم می‌تواند منشأ حیات را توضیح دهد؟\nنه! علم تاکنون منشأ حیات را با جزئیات کامل توضیح نداده است؛ اما پژوهشگران در حال ارائه تئوری ای هستند که افق آن توضیح کامل چگونگی ترکیبات و واکنش های شیمیایی است که می‌توانند منجر به ظهور حیات شود.\nاین پاسخی بود به جستجوی منشاء حیات، تا جایی که تاکنون می‌فهمیم.\nمنابع  یوتیوب    traits\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n

رعایت شود، کل دنیا درست می شود. این حدیث در توضیح این آیه از قرآن است که می فرماید:\n لَن تَنَالُوا الْبِرَّ حَتَّىٰ تُنفِقُوا مِمَّا تُحِبُّونَ ۚ وَمَا تُنفِقُوا مِن شَيْءٍ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ بِهِ عَلِيمٌ\n هرگز به حقیقت لذّت عقلی تقوا نمی رسید الا اینکه از آنچیزی که دوست دارید در راه خدا انفاق کنید.\nاز نظر قرآن، انفاق برای سالکی که در پی سیر به خوبی هاست نقش اساسی دارد. اما انفاق آدابی دارد:\nانفاق از آنچه شان خود ماست اینکه دارایی مستهلک یا غیر قابل استفاده خودمان را که به آن رغبت و نیازی نداریم بخواهیم به دیگری بدهیم، انفاق حساب نمی شود. اگر می خواهیم لباسی را انفاق کنیم، باید لباس نو خودمان را ببخشیم.\nرعایت احترام و کرامت شخص  وكَرَّمْنَا بَنِي آدَمَ وَفَضَّلْنَاهُمْ عَلَىٰ كَثِيرٍ مِّمَّنْ خَلَقْنَا تَفْضِيلًا\n انسان کریم آفریده شده است. مبادا وقتی می خواهیم انفاقی کنیم، خود را برتر بدانیم و شخص نیازمند را متاثّر کنیم.\nپرهیز از یادآوری انفاق انفاق خود را با منّت گذاشتن و یادآوری کردن، جهنمی نکنیم. حضرت علی (ع) می فرماید:\n اللِّسَانُ سَبُعٌ إِنْ خُلِّيَ عَنْهُ

الرحمه) می فرماید:\n ندارد کسی با تو ناگفته کار/ ولیکن چو گفتی دلیلش بیار\n حال اگر اینطور بودیم و رفتار کردیم، حالا امام هادی با شما کار دارد. می فرماید، محبوب ترین و نزدیک ترین شخص به من کسی است که

طَيِّبَةً كَشَجَرَةٍ طَيِّبَةٍ أَصْلُهَا ثَابِتٌ وَفَرْعُهَا فِي السَّمَاءِ﴾ ﴿ تُؤْتِي أُكُلَهَا كُلَّ حِينٍ بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهَا ۗ وَيَضْرِبُ اللَّهُ الْأَمْثَالَ لِلنَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَذَكَّرُونَ﴾ ﴿ وَمَثَلُ كَلِمَةٍ خَبِيثَةٍ كَشَجَرَةٍ خَبِيثَةٍ اجْتُثَّتْ مِن فَوْقِ الْأَرْضِ مَا لَهَا مِن قَرَارٍ﴾ ﴿ يُثَبِّتُ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا بِالْقَوْلِ الثَّابِتِ فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا وَفِي الْآخِرَةِ ۖ وَيُضِلُّ اللَّهُ الظَّالِمِينَ ۚ وَيَفْعَلُ اللَّهُ مَا يَشَاءُ﴾ [ إبراهيم: 27]\n تربیت، قرار گرفتن کلمه ی طیّب در جان انسان است. به نظر می رسد ساختار وجودی انسان اینگونه عمل می کند که در زیر ساخت وجودی ما کلماتی نقش بسته است. باید به درون رفت و دید رفتار ما از چه کلماتی در درون نشات می گیرد. کلمات در سِیر زندگی و توسط محیط در درون ما جا پیدا کرده اند.\nاحساس سعادت یا شقاوت، تحت تاثیر این کلمات در حال ما شکل می گیرد.\nسوال: کلمات چند دسته اند؟ جایگاه کلمات در عالم چیست؟ هر کلمه ای چه آثاری در سیر انسانی ایجاد می کند؟\nقرآن در توصیف کلمات می فرماید کلمات در دو دسته اند: کلمات خبیث و کلمات طیب.\nتعریف قرآنی کلمه طیّب کلمه طیب مانند درختی است که ریشه آن در زمین است و ثابت و شاخه هایش در آسمان است. یعنی کلمه طیب سر جای خوش است. اگر هر چیزی سر جای خوش نباشد و جای خود را پیدا نکند، اوضاع ناجوری می شود. به اذن پروردگارش هم همیشه میوه می دهد.\nتعریف قرآنی کلمه خبیث کلمه خبیث مثل درختی است که از ریشه درآمده و قرار ندارد و جای ثابتی ندارد.\n23 آیه ابتدایی سوره ابراهیم به ذکر عناوینی از کلمات طیبه و خبیثه می پردازد. قرآن با معرفی کلمات طیب و خبیث مار را از ظلمات به سمت نور هدایت می کند.\nکلمات خبیثه در قرآن من بهترم  ﴿\u0026hellip; قَالَ أَنَا خَيْرٌ \u0026hellip;﴾ [ الأعراف: 12]\n من بهترم. هرجا شما چنین کلمه ای در زندگی تان آمد، زندگی تان، تلخ می شود. اولین کسی که از کلمه ی بهتر استفاده کرده است شیطان است. ما در ادبیات دینی بهتر نداریم. دیگر داریم.\nتحمیل نظر و مُکرَه کردن دیگران  ﴿قَالَ فِرْعَوْنُ مَا أُرِيكُمْ إِلَّا مَا أَرَىٰ وَمَا أَهْدِيكُمْ إِلَّا سَبِيلَ الرَّشَادِ﴾ [غافر: 29]\n لا اکراه فی الدین. اکراه یعنی من یک چیزی را دوست ندارم و به من تحمیل شود. نمی توانید چنین کاری کنید. هیچ اکراهی در روش زندگی نیست. اگر شما چیزی را به من اکراه کنی، زندگی من را تلخ می کنی.\nخود را منشاء اثر دانستن  ﴿ قَالَ إِنَّمَا أُوتِيتُهُ عَلَىٰ عِلْمٍ عِندِي﴾[ القصص: 78]\n قارون می گوید موفقیت من ناشی از علمی است که نزد من بود.\nبه انحراف کشاندن کلمات علاوه بر مطرح شدن کلمات طیبه و خبیثه در قرآن، پدیده ی دیگری نیز در قرآن مورد اشاره قرار می گیرد و آن به انحراف کشاندن یا خارج کردن کلمات از مواضع شان است.\n ﴿ مِّنَ الَّذِينَ هَادُوا يُحَرِّفُونَ الْكَلِمَ عَن مَّوَاضِعِهِ وَيَقُولُونَ سَمِعْنَا وَعَصَيْنَا وَاسْمَعْ غَيْرَ مُسْمَعٍ وَرَاعِنَا لَيًّا بِأَلْسِنَتِهِمْ وَطَعْنًا فِي الدِّينِ ۚ﴾ [ سورة النساء: 46]\n نتیجه این انحراف این است که آن بهره ای که از ذکر کلمات داشته اند را پس از آن نخواهند داشت:\n ﴿ فَبِمَا نَقْضِهِم مِّيثَاقَهُمْ لَعَنَّاهُمْ وَجَعَلْنَا قُلُوبَهُمْ قَاسِيَةً ۖ يُحَرِّفُونَ الْكَلِمَ عَن مَّوَاضِعِهِ ۙ وَنَسُوا حَظًّا مِّمَّا ذُكِّرُوا بِهِ ۚ وَلَا تَزَالُ تَطَّلِعُ عَلَىٰ خَائِنَةٍ مِّنْهُمْ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا مِّنْهُمْ ۖ فَاعْفُ عَنْهُمْ وَاصْفَحْ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُحِبُّ الْمُحْسِنِينَ﴾ [ سورة المائدة: 13]\n این کلمات دیگر سیر من الظلمات الی النور نمی دهد. قرآن هست ولی هدایت نمی کند! بهره ای ندارد.\n باران که در لطافت طبعش خلاف نیست/ در باغ لاله روید و در شوره بوم خس\n چگونه می توان تربیت کرد؟ با کشف و ارائه هنرمندانه کلمات طیبه و خبیثه. مثلا در قالب ضرب المثل، شعر، داستان یا موسیقی.\nو چقدر ما ظلم کردیم در چهل و اندی سال به موسیقی. تنها کشور گاگولی در دنیا که آلات موسیقی را در تلوزیون نشان نمی دهد ما هستیم.\n","date":"2023-07-01T00:00:00Z","image":"https://ziaenezhad.ir/p/%D9%BE%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%88%D9%86-%DA%A9%D9%84%D9%85%D9%87-%D8%B7%DB%8C%D8%A8-%D9%88-%D8%AE%D8%A8%DB%8C%D8%AB/cover_hu3d03a01dcc18bc5be0e67db3d8d209a6_125427_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://ziaenezhad.ir/p/%D9%BE%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%88%D9%86-%DA%A9%D9%84%D9%85%D9%87-%D8%B7%DB%8C%D8%A8-%D9%88-%D8%AE%D8%A8%DB%8C%D8%AB/","title":"پیرامون

مشغول آن بود، باید به سرانجام می رسید. پس برای پیدا کردن یک اتاق کار مناسب از خانه خارج شدم.\nفرصت نبود و بدون زحمت زیاد، اتاق محقّری پیدا شد. کوچک بود اما دوستش داشتم. برای کار من -یعنی نوشتن- کافی به نظر می رسید.\nحالم خوش بود و بلافاصله کار را شروع کردم. با خودم گفتم: \u0026ldquo;این جایی ست که کتابم در آن متولد می شود.\u0026rdquo; اما از همان ابتدا اتفاقات عجیب رخ داد.\nآن روز وقتی پشت میز در حال کار بودم، دفعتاً میل به قهوه کردم.در اتاق قهوه نبود. باید به کافه می رفتم. روان نویسم را رو میز گذاشتم و بیرون رفتم.\nوقتی بازگشتم هر چه دنبال قلمم که بر روی میز گذاشته بودم گشتم، نبود. روی صندلی و زیر میز، روی زمین هم نبود. گیج کننده بود. این امکان نداشت.\nشب؛ اتفاق عجیب دبگری هم رخ داد. توی تخت بودم و اتاق کاملا ساکت بود، وحشت زده از خواب پریدم. صدای ناله از کجا بود؟ آن صدای مبهم و ضعیف مردانه.\nفریاد کشیدم: \u0026ldquo;که آنجاست؟\u0026rdquo; کسی جواب نداد. کسی داخل اتاق نبود. نمی توانستم بفهمم و ترسیده بودم. \u0026ldquo;صدای چه بود؟ باید چه می کردم؟\u0026rdquo;\nآن اتفاقات عجیب هر

آن غریبه را دیدم. تصویر من نبودم. او ریش داشت، اما من نه! پلک هایم را به هم فشار دادم و دوباره که نگاه کردم نبود. چهره خودم در آینه بود. با خودم گفتم: \u0026ldquo;اشتباه کردی. هیچ کس دیگه ای جز من اینجا نبوده و نیست.\u0026rdquo;\nنمی توانستم کار کنم. نمی خواستم در اتاق بمانم. از خانه خارج شدم. نمی خواستم دوباره دچار آن توهمات شوم. آن صدای عجیب یا آن چهره.\nنیمه شب، خسته به اتاق بازگشتم. اتاق کاملا ساکت و تاریک بود. به آینه نگاه کردم. چهره خودم بود. خوشحال نشدم.\nبه تخت رفتم تا استراحت کنم. خوابم نمی برد. کار کتاب عقب بود. با خودم فکر کردم بهتر است فردا از این اتاق بروم. پس از آن به خواب رفتم.\nناگهان حالت عجیب دیگری رخ داد. آن بیگانه در کنار تختم ایستاده بود و با من صحبت می کرد: \u0026ldquo;تو اینجا خواهی ماند. تو اینجا را ترک نخواهی کرد!\u0026rdquo;\nچشمانم باز بود. احساس سردی می کردم و وحشت زده بودم. از جا پریدم. گفتم: \u0026ldquo;اینجا حتی برای یک دقیقه دیگر جای ماندن نیست. باید همین الآن از اینجا بروم.\u0026rdquo;\nوسایلم را به سختی در چمدان چپاندم. فقط می خواستم دیگر آنجا نباشم. نمی توانستم آن تصویر سرد را از ذهنم پا کنم. نمی دانستم آن وهم موحش از کجا می آمد و مرا چه چیزی تا این می ترساند.\nچمدان را بلند کردم و به سمت در رفتم. چشمم به آینه خیره ماند. نفسم حبس شد. هیچ چیز درون آینه نبود، نه من و نه حتی آن غریبه. امّا من چرا درون آینه نیستم؟ چرا خودم را نمی توانستم ببینم؟\nباید فریاد می کشیدم و از کسی کمک می خواستم ولی نفسم از حنجره ام خارج نمی شد. صدایی نداشتم. به اطراف چرخیدم. سرم که برگشت، ناگهام او را دیدم. این بار نه در آینه، بلکه پشت میز تحریر من و با قلم من در دست. او داشت کتاب مرا می نوشت!\nتقلّا کردم چیزی به او بگویم، اما صدایم در نمی آمد. انگار صدایی نداشتم. نشد و او ساکت و لبخند بر لب همچنان می نوشت.\nناگهان از پشت در صدای آشنایی به گوش رسید. صدای یک دوست: \u0026ldquo;آنجایی؟ صدای من را می شنوی؟ آمدم ببینمت. در را باز کن!\u0026rdquo;\nامیدوار شدم. فکر کردم، او حتما به کمک من خواهد آمد و مرا از این کابوس نجات خواهد داد.\nغریبه به سمت در رفت و در را باز کرد. به دوستم گفت: \u0026ldquo;بیا تو! بیا و اتاقم را ببین. کار کتابم داره به آخرش می

Shut: گذشته فعل shut که معمولا به عنوان واحد عکاسی در ذهنم بود. برای بستن چشم هم به کار می رود. مثلا: I shut my eyes and looked again.
