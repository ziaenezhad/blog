class=article-content><h1 id=معرفی>معرفی</h1><p>کتاب <strong>504 واژه ضروری</strong> یکی از منابع محبوب و معتبر برای یادگیری واژگان زبان انگلیسی است که توسط دانشجویان، زبان‌آموزان و حتی افراد حرفه‌ای مورد استفاده قرار می‌گیرد. این کتاب شامل واژگانی است که در بسیاری از آزمون‌های زبان انگلیسی مانند TOEFL، IELTS و GRE مورد نیاز است.</p><p>از آنجا که یادگیری واژگان جدید ممکن است برای برخی افراد چالش‌برانگیز باشد، داشتن یک رویکرد منظم و سیستماتیک می‌تواند فرآیند یادگیری را تسهیل کند. در این مقاله، ما قصد داریم لیستی از مثال‌های کتاب <strong>504</strong> واژه ضروری را از آسان به سخت ارائه دهیم تا زبان‌آموزان بتوانند به تدریج و با افزایش سطح دشواری، مهارت‌های واژگان خود را بهبود بخشند.</p><p>با این روش، یادگیری واژگان جدید نه تنها کارآمدتر، بلکه لذت‌بخش‌تر نیز خواهد بود.</p><h1
