انگلیسی است که به طور ویژه به تقویت دایره لغات زبان آموزان می‌پردازد. این کتاب به صورت گسترده در دوره‌های زبان انگلیسی استفاده می‌شود و هدف آن افزایش دانش واژگان از طریق معرفی <strong>504</strong> واژه ضروری است که در مکالمات و متون انگلیسی روزمره بسیار کاربرد دارند.</p><p>ساختار کتاب به گونه‌ای است که هر کلمه به همراه تعریف، مثال و جمله‌ای که آن کلمه در آن استفاده شده، آورده شده است. این روش باعث می‌شود که زبان آموز نه تنها معنای کلمه را بداند بلکه نحوه استفاده صحیح از آن در جمله را نیز یاد بگیرد. همچنین، کتاب شامل تمرینات متنوعی است که به یادگیری و تثبیت این واژگان کمک می‌کند.</p><h1
